RBC Dataset Status Report (DSR)

CCNP
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/testing/colornest/bidsdatasets
RIA Address:
DSR: We undid the applied changes and re-applied them using new clustering/config, and saved those changes. We ran fmriprep on acq groups BEFORE we undid and re-applied changes using new clustering.
Next Steps: We will push the new version back to PMACS, add README + Authors, and run the new version of the entire dataset through fmriprep.

HRC
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/HRC/working/HRC_datalad
DSR: We applied changes, and are re-running validation on the apply1 branch using new subject by subject validator.
Next Steps: If validation comes out clean, save and then can push to PMACS, run bond-copy-exemplars, and begin acq group testing.

PNC
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/PNC
DSR: Added missing Parallel Reduction Factor In Plane values to one T1w and one dwi scan, purge is running now on the two incomplete dwi scans and their counterpart runs.
Next Steps: Save and re-validate post purge, checkout apply1 branch, and apply changes.

HBN
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/HBN
DSR: Re-running validation using new subject by subject validator.
Next Steps: Already checked out an includes-incompletes branch, so can run purge on the 16 bold scans with less than 3 mins of data and all dwi scans validator identifies as having volume count mismatch (will liikely be 16 dwi so 32 total). Add events tsvs (have peer, need movieDM and movieTP). Re-validate post purge, then add subject level events tsvs, then re-group using new clustering/config, adjust params, and apply changes.

NKI
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/NKI
DSR: Saved NKI, running validate and group now to see where we are at.
Next Steps: Want to see which config values we want to adjust.
