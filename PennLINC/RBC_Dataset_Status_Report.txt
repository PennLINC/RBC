RBC Dataset Status Report (DSR)

CCNP (GONG)
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/testing/colornest/bidsdatasets
Final CuBIDS Outputs: https://github.com/PennLINC/RBC/tree/master/PennLINC/CCNP_BIDS_Fix
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: Pushed back to PMACS. Ran new validate on CCNP post apply and got 3 inconsistent subjects, which make sense. We ran fmriprep on acq groups BEFORE we undid and re-applied changes using new clustering.
Next Steps: Add back README + Authors and rerun exemplars.

HRC
ISSUE: Need 11 subjects not on GLOBUS, we had empty directories for them on cubic
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/HRC/working/HRC_datalad
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: Emailed HRC Team list of 11 subjects missing data. Re-group and re-apply changes with HRC_suggest_all.yml
Next Steps: Wait for Brazil OR save and push to PMACS, run bond-copy-exemplars, and begin acq group testing.

PNC GONG
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/PNC
Datalad Status: saved apply1
Git Branch: master
DSR: GONGED VERSION saved on apply1 branch! Saved apply1 changes, and validation came out clean.
Next Steps: Merge apply1 into main branch and PUSH TO PMACS!

HBN
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/HBN
Datalad Status: saved
Git Branch: master
DSR: Find Lei's defacing code! Purge 7 scans with super low Dim1Size. Identify and keep best run of the 137 subjects with multiple runs of T1w scans.
Next Steps: Re-validate and re-group. Add events tsvs (have peer, need movieDM and movieTP). Decide on tolerances.

NKI
Datalad Status: untracked changes (deleted all physio .tsv.gz + .json files)
Git Branch: main
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/NKI
DSR: Decide on config params and truncate subject level events tsvs. 
Next Steps: Re-validate and re-group after truncating subject level events tsvs.
