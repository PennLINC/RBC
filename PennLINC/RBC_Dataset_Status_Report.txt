RBC Dataset Status Report (DSR)

RIA Store: ssh://sciget.pmacs.upenn.edu/project/RBC/RIA/BIDS/970/4eab1-3320-41f0-9fce-3c6961b4ac96
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/testing/colornest/bidsdatasets
Final CuBIDS Outputs: https://github.com/PennLINC/RBC/tree/master/PennLINC/CCNP_BIDS_Fix
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: Fmriprep finished running on exemplars. 
Next Steps: Audit exmplars (with unzipping)! Add back README + Authors and run all subjects through fmriprep. 

HRC
ISSUE: Need 11 subjects not on GLOBUS, we had empty directories for them on cubic
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/HRC/working/HRC_datalad
Datalad Status: untracked (added 11 missing subjects + nift info)
Git Branch: master
DSR: Add nifti info finished running after addding in 10 previously missing subjects. Group and validate are running now. 
Next Steps: Add in 11th (and final) missing subject once dropbox permissions change. Save, re Save, checkout apply2 branch and rerun apply. Save and push to PMACS, run bond-copy-exemplars, and begin acq group testing.

Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/PNC
Datalad Status: untracked (NumVolumes=1.0 for 3D scans being added)
Git Branch: master
DSR: Fmriprep finished running on exemplars. 
Next Steps: Audit and run fmriprep on the entire dataset!

HBN
RIA Store: ssh://sciget.pmacs.upenn.edu/project/RBC/RIA/BIDS/b32/508c1-d2c1-4b40-a3e3-48df49e7fa56
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/HBN
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: We pushed HBN to PMACS. Next we purged 14 dwi scans with low number of volumes (less than dominant 129) and 9 unusable T1s/T2s with super low Dim1Size (20-32 voxels). We then reran the now backwards compatible add-nifti-info so that 3D scans got NumVoluems=1.0 added to their sidecars. Next we checked out an extra-anats branch, and Matt is currently working on a script that will delete extra T1s and remove 'run' from the T1s we keep. 
Next Steps: Add events tsvs (have peer, need movieDM and movieTP). Decide on tolerances, apply changes, and push back to PMACS.

NKI
Datalad Status: untracked changes (Matt added 45/51 missing jsons, Sydney purged 20 dwi scans with low num vols)
Git Branch: main
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/NKI
DSR: We purged 20 dwi scans with low number of volumes (less than dominant 137). We then identified that NKI was missing 51 sidcars. We uploaded 45/51 of the missing sidecars, and Alex is checking to see if he has the last 6. We then realized we accidentally initialized NKI as a datalad dataset without text2git, so the sidecars were in git annex. To keep things consistent with the other RBC datasets, we unlocked and ran datalad run-procedure cfg_text2git to remove the jsons from git annex. We uplodaded the T2s for subjects we currently have in NKI from s3 to cubic and ran add nifti info, which just finished running, and group/validate are running now. 
Next Steps: Find out if CMI is going to continue uploading data. They have T2s on s3 for subjects we don't currently have in NKI. Get missing jsons, decide on config params, and truncate subject level events tsvs. 


HBN ISSUES 
- ALL: ADD SITE-SI SCANS? THEY ARE ALL IN THEIR OWN PARAM GROUPS (32 GROUPS TOTAL)! 
- ANAT: Change T1 key group with no acq value to acquisition-SI
- ANAT: Need to delete some T2s, waiting on CMI for which ones (Mike or Alex)
- ANAT: RULE FOR T1s: Ideally, keep the VnavNorm scan with the highest rating. If unscored, keep best one (from plot), if can't tell difference, keep first run. If no VnavNorm, keep Vnav. If neither, keep HCP. 
- DWI + FMAP: tolerate Effective Echo Spacing, Total Readout Time, and Repetition Time
- FMAP: lots of missing PRFIP and MAF, want this in filename? want separate group because of this? SHORTHAND FOR ACQUISITION (UNSET SUGGEST VARIANT RENAME)! 
- FMAP: tolerate VoxelSizeDim1 (0.05mm)

NKI ISSUES
- 6 T1 sidecars are still missing
- T2s? 

MISSING DATA

NKI has 6 T1 scans still missing sidecars
