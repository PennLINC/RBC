RBC Dataset Status Report (DSR)

CCNP (GONG)
RIA Store: ssh://sciget.pmacs.upenn.edu/project/RBC/RIA/BIDS/970/4eab1-3320-41f0-9fce-3c6961b4ac96
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets
Final CuBIDS Outputs: https://github.com/PennLINC/RBC/tree/master/PennLINC/CCNP_BIDS_Fix
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: Audit ran successfully on both fieldmapped and fieldmappless fmriprep production outputs. Ran XCP on fieldmapped outputs and audited.
Next Steps: Rerun XCP with stable version. Audit. Add README + Authors.

HRC (GONG)
RIA Store: ssh://sciget.pmacs.upenn.edu/project/RBC/RIA/BIDS/98f/55d34-d001-40ac-8056-db2803d3280f
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/HRC
Datalad Status: unlocked
Git Branch: main
DSR: We ran the entire dataset through multisession fmriprep. Testing/tweaking multisession fmriprep audit now.
Next Steps: If we decide to use fieldmapless (post running XCP on CCNP fieldmapless fmriprep outputs), audit the fmriprep fieldmapless/multi-session fmriprep outputs. Run the entire dataset through fieldmapless/multi-session fmriprep. Audit. Then move onto XCP. Audit.

PNC (GONG)
TODO: DECIDE IF WE WANT TO USE NEW OR OLD XCP (AZEEZ AND MAX, CHECK CORRELATION BETWEEN OLD AND NEW ON CCNP BEFORE USING NEW ON PNC)
RIA Store: ssh://sciget.pmacs.upenn.edu/project/RBC/RIA/BIDS/6a5/7d847-1441-442d-81d7-04ca51526645
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/PNC
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: Fmriprep finished running on the entire dataset. Ran the new bootstrap version of the audit + concatenator on the fmriprep outputs, which revealed that all subject succeeded except the 40 with no bold data and one with a garbage T1w scan. Max ran XCP on the fmriprep outputs. Testing the XCP bootstrap audit now.  
Next Steps: Rerun XCP with stable, tagged version (wait for go ahead from Azeez). Run bootstrap XCP audit on the entire output set. Run qsiprep on exemplars, once Matt is done with run by session. Waiting on patch 2 self (test on NKI!).

HBN
ISSUE: HBN MIGHT NEED A git gc !!!
TODO: add to datalad save commit messge retroactively: removed 32 new subjects, purged 9 acq-dwi unused fmaps, removed 4 site-RU subjects with only 1/2 a functional scan.
RIA Store: ssh://sciget.pmacs.upenn.edu/project/RBC/RIA/BIDS/b32/508c1-d2c1-4b40-a3e3-48df49e7fa56
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/HBN
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: apply1
DSR: Added run to RU task-rest scans originally missing it and acq-ABCD to scans collected with abcd protocol. Ran qsiprep on exemplars and audited. Resubmitted 2 subjects from the groups whose exemplars had trash scans. Merged apply1 into main. 
Next Steps: Remove fmap dirs for subjects in exemplar groups with acq-ABCD and all same PED.

NKI (GONG)
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/NKI
DSR: Submitted nki exemplar fmriprep jobs. Merged apply1 into main! Realized ran fmriprep using normal NOT multisite bootstrap. Resubmitted copy-exemplars. Resubmitted the fmriprep exemplar runs using the multistie bootstrap.
Next Steps: Matt test qsiprep on NKI TRT subs, Sydney run exemplars through fmriprep. Merge apply1 into main. Get Alex and Ted to sign off on post-apply output! Create sibling and push to pmacs! Merge apply1 into main. Push to pmacs again!


HRC ISSUES
- VALIDATION: 11 new subs still quick validation failing ('bids dir structure doesn't match' description so maybe just having an issue with ses-3?) using the --sequential flag! Matt and I found nothing wrong with them (likely just need to debug the new flag. They passed validation WITHOUT the sequential flag.
