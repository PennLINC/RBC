RBC Dataset Status Report (DSR)

CCNP
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/testing/colornest/bidsdatasets
Final CuBIDS Outputs: https://github.com/PennLINC/RBC/tree/master/PennLINC/CCNP_BIDS_Fix
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: Ran new validate on CCNP post apply and got 3 inconsistent subjects, which make sense. We ran fmriprep on acq groups BEFORE we undid and re-applied changes using new clustering.
Next Steps: Push back to PMACS, add README + Authors, rerun exemplars.

HRC
ISSUE: Need 11 subjects not on GLOBUS, we had empty directories for them on cubic
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/HRC/working/HRC_datalad
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: Emailed HRC Team list of 11 subjects missing data. Re-group and re-apply changes with HRC_suggest_all.yml
Next Steps: Wait for Brazil OR save and push to PMACS, run bond-copy-exemplars, and begin acq group testing.

PNC
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/PNC
Datalad Status: saved
Git Branch: apply1
DSR: Apply running now on apply1 branch!! 
Next Steps: Get sign offs on csv and PUSH TO PMACS!

HBN
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/HBN
Datalad Status: untracked (T2s)
Git Branch: master
DSR: Realized needed to run add-nifti-info post Lei adding T2s and 6 missing T1w jsons, so doing that now. Will validate and regroup after. Validate and group came out clean (post Lei adding T2s), Lei added T2s, status, group, and validate running now. Save finished. Checked out new apply1 branch, Lei merging T2s in on main branch now. Purge + addition of jsons save running now. Lei (or me) will add in T2s when save finishes. CHECKOUT A NEW BRANCH CALLED no-T2s FIRST, then add to master!
Next Steps: Post save, rerun validation and group. Then add events tsvs (have peer, need movieDM and movieTP). Decide on tolerances.

NKI
Datalad Status: untracked changes (deleted all physio .tsv.gz + .json files)
Git Branch: main
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/NKI
DSR: Validate finished successfully. Now need to talk groupings and events tsvs! Validate running now post getting rid of checkpoints and test files. Saved Deletion all files except *_physio.tsv.gz and *_physio.json off physio branch. Saving deletion of all *_physio.* (ran find . -name 'sub-*physio.*' | xargs git rm) from main branch. All validation issues due to physio files are gone (yay). Moved test files out of BIDS directory and re-ran validation. Now there should just be Suspiciously long event design warnigns left. 
Next Steps: Truncate existing subject level tsvs! See which config values we want to adjust.
