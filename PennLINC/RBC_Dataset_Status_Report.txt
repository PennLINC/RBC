Reproducible Brain Chart Dataset Status Report (RBC DSR)

CCNP (GONG)
*PREPS FINISHED: fmriprep (exemplars + full ds)
RIA Store: ssh://sciget.pmacs.upenn.edu/project/RBC/RIA/BIDS/970/4eab1-3320-41f0-9fce-3c6961b4ac96
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets
Final CuBIDS Outputs: https://github.com/PennLINC/RBC/tree/master/PennLINC/CCNP_BIDS_Fix
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: Audit ran successfully on both fieldmapped and fieldmappless fmriprep production outputs. Ran XCP on fieldmapped outputs and audited.
Next Steps: Rerun XCP with stable version. Audit. Add README + Authors.

HRC (GONG)
*PREPS FINISHED:
RIA Store: ssh://sciget.pmacs.upenn.edu/project/RBC/RIA/BIDS/98f/55d34-d001-40ac-8056-db2803d3280f
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/HRC
Datalad Status: saved, clean 
Git Branch: main
DSR: We ran the entire dataset through fieldmapless+multisession fmriprep. 
Next Steps: Rerun fmriprep on exemplars (multisession, FIELDMAPPED) and audit. Run fmriprep on the entire dataset and audit.

PNC (GONG)
*PREPS FINISHED: fmriprep (exemplars + full ds)  
RIA Store: ssh://sciget.pmacs.upenn.edu/project/RBC/RIA/BIDS/6a5/7d847-1441-442d-81d7-04ca51526645

Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: Fmriprep finished running on the entire dataset. Ran the new bootstrap version of the audit + concatenator on the fmriprep outputs, which revealed that all subject succeeded except the 40 with no bold data and one with a garbage T1w scan. Max ran XCP on the fmriprep outputs. Testing the XCP bootstrap audit now.  
Next Steps: Run qsiprep on exemplars. Rerun XCP with stable, tagged version (wait for go ahead from Azeez) and audit.

HBN (GONG)
*PREPS FINISHED: fmriprep (exemplars)
BIDS RIA Store: ssh://sciget.pmacs.upenn.edu/project/RBC/RIA/BIDS/b32/508c1-d2c1-4b40-a3e3-48df49e7fa56
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/HBN
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: main 
DSR: Added run to RU task-rest scans originally missing it and acq-ABCD to scans collected with abcd protocol. Ran qsiprep on exemplars and audited. Resubmitted 2 subjects from the groups whose exemplars had trash scans. Merged apply1 into main. Qsubbed purge on dwi fmaps for subjects with acq-ABCD64dir dwi scans and subjects where the dwi scan and dwi fmaps all have the same PED (j-). Full list of purged scans found at abcd64dir_samePED_dwi_fmaps_to_delete.txt.
Next Steps: Group/validate. Save. Audit replacement exemplar qsiprep outputs. Audit hbn fmriprep outputs.

NKI (GONG)
*PREPS FINISHED: 
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
BIDS RIA Store: 
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/NKI
DSR: Last few NKI exemplar fmriprep jobs running now.
Next Steps: Push to PMACS. Audit fmriprep exemplar outputs. Test qsiprep on NKI TRT subs.








HRC ISSUES
- VALIDATION: 11 new subs still quick validation failing ('bids dir structure doesn't match' description so maybe just having an issue with ses-3?) using the --sequential flag! Matt and I found nothing wrong with them (likely just need to debug the new flag. They passed validation WITHOUT the sequential flag. 

HBN TODO
TODO: add to datalad save commit messge retroactively: removed 32 new subjects, purged 9 acq-dwi unused fmaps, removed 4 site-RU subjects with only 1/2 a functional scan.
