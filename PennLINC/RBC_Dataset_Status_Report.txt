Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/testing/colornest/bidsdatasets
Final CuBIDS Outputs: https://github.com/PennLINC/RBC/tree/master/PennLINC/CCNP_BIDS_Fix
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: Fmriprep finished running on exemplars. 
Next Steps: Audit exmplars (with unzipping)! Add back README + Authors and run all subjects through fmriprep. 

HRC
ISSUE: Need 11 subjects not on GLOBUS, we had empty directories for them on cubic
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/HRC/working/HRC_datalad
Datalad Status: untracked (added 11 missing subjects + nift info)
Git Branch: master
DSR: Add nifti info running now. VALIDATION ISSUES 11 SUBJECTS ??!? REC-REFACED BEFORE RUN INSTEAD OF AFTER!!! AND NO BVAL/BVEC FOR DWI
Next Steps: Run group/validate! Save, re Save, checkout apply2 branch and rerun apply. Save and push to PMACS, run bond-copy-exemplars, and begin acq group testing.

Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/PNC
Datalad Status: untracked (NumVolumes=1.0 for 3D scans being added)
Git Branch: master
DSR: Fmriprep finished running on exemplars. 
Next Steps: Audit and run fmriprep on the entire dataset!

RIA Store: ssh://sciget.pmacs.upenn.edu/project/RBC/RIA/BIDS/b32/508c1-d2c1-4b40-a3e3-48df49e7fa56
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/HBN
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: We pushed HBN to PMACS. Next we purged 14 dwi scans with low number of volumes (less than dominant 129) and 9 unusable T1s/T2s with super low Dim1Size (20-32 voxels). We then reran the now backwards compatible add-nifti-info so that 3D scans got NumVolumes=1.0 added to their sidecars. Next we checked out an extra-anats branch, Matt deleted extra T1s and remove 'run' from the T1s we keep and saved. Validation/group running now! 
Next Steps: Add-nifti-info! RERUN ADD NIFT INFO AFTER T1S ARE DELETED! Keep VNav-Norm T2. Add events tsvs (have peer, need movieDM and movieTP). Decide on tolerances, apply changes, and push back to PMACS.

NKI
Datalad Status: untracked changes (Matt added 45/51 missing jsons, Sydney purged 20 dwi scans with low num vols)
Git Branch: main
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/NKI
DSR: We purged 20 dwi scans with low number of volumes (less than dominant 137). We then identified that NKI was missing 51 sidcars. We uploaded 45/51 of the missing sidecars, and Alex is checking to see if he has the last 6. We then realized we accidentally initialized NKI as a datalad dataset without text2git, so the sidecars were in git annex. To keep things consistent with the other RBC datasets, we unlocked and ran datalad run-procedure cfg_text2git to remove the jsons from git annex. We uplodaded the T2s for subjects we currently have in NKI from s3 to cubic. Add nift info ran!! Matt needs to upload the T2 for the sidecar missing a nifti. 
Next Steps: Rerun add-nifti-info (if Matt uploads new sidecar). Rerun group/validate. Ask Alex if they are currently still collecting data (Ted). They have T2s on s3 for subjects we don't currently have in NKI. Get 6 missing jsons, decide on config params, and truncate subject level events tsvs. 


HBN ISSUES 
- ALL: ADD SITE-SI SCANS? THEY ARE ALL IN THEIR OWN PARAM GROUPS (32 GROUPS TOTAL)! 
- ANAT: Change T1 key group with no acq value to acquisition-SI
- ANAT: Need to delete some T2s, waiting on CMI for which ones (Mike or Alex)
- ANAT: RULE FOR T1s: Ideally, keep the VnavNorm scan with the highest rating. If unscored, keep best one (from plot), if can't tell difference, keep first run. If no VnavNorm, keep Vnav. If neither, keep HCP. 
- DWI + FMAP: tolerate Effective Echo Spacing, Total Readout Time, and Repetition Time
- FMAP: lots of missing PRFIP and MAF, want this in filename? want separate group because of this? SHORTHAND FOR ACQUISITION (UNSET SUGGEST VARIANT RENAME)! 
- FMAP: tolerate VoxelSizeDim1 (0.05mm)

HRC ISSUES
(1) The 11 subjects they just sent us are all missing bvals and bvecs for the dwi scans. The list of subjects missing bvals/bvecs is below (same list of 11 subjects that were previously missing all data).

HBN ISSUES
(1) sub-NDARXJ973GFA has two HCP T1ws, but the images look like they are of two different people. Alex is looking into the dicoms now to try to find out what happened.

NKI ISSUES
(1) sub-A00074953 has a T2 with a sidecar but no corresponding nifti. The following is the path to the sidecar missing a nifti: sub-A00074953/ses-TRT/anat/sub-A00074953_ses-TRT_T2w.json. This nifti is not on s3. 

(2) There are 22 subjects on s3 that are currently missing from our RBC repository. Do we want to add these subjects to RBC? Additionally, is CMI still collecting data for NKI? See below for the full list of subjects on s3 but not currently in RBC:
