Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/testing/colornest/bidsdatasets
Final CuBIDS Outputs: https://github.com/PennLINC/RBC/tree/master/PennLINC/CCNP_BIDS_Fix
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: Fmriprep finished running on exemplars. Audit came out clean. Fmriprep finished running on production. Audit running now. 
Next Steps: Check audit. Add back README + Authors. Run exemplars through qsiprep. 

HRC
ISSUE: Need 11 subjects not on GLOBUS, we had empty directories for them on cubic
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/HRC/working/HRC_datalad
Datalad Status: clean, saved
Git Branch: apply3
DSR: Save running now on apply2. Still validation errors on 11 new subs. Group/validate running now. Add nifti info running now. Brazil added bvals/bvecs for 11 new subs from third wave, and we uploaded them to cubic. Saved. Ran Group/validate. Checked out apply2 branch. Ran apply! Re-ran group with no TRT in dwi and func. Checked out apply3 branch. Apply ran on apply3 branch. Validation came out the same (no sequential worked, with sequential failed on 11 new subs with ses-3). 
Next Steps: Merge apply into main. Push to PMACS. Run bond-copy-exemplars, and begin acq group testing.

Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: Fmriprep finished running on exemplars. Audit revealed 5 acq groups with no bold scans. Fmriprep running now on all subjects. 
Next Steps: Audit. Run qsiprep on exemplars.

HBN
RIA Store: ssh://sciget.pmacs.upenn.edu/project/RBC/RIA/BIDS/b32/508c1-d2c1-4b40-a3e3-48df49e7fa56
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/HBN
Datalad Status: saved, clean
Git Branch: master
DSR: We pushed HBN to PMACS. Next we purged 14 dwi scans with low number of volumes (less than dominant 129) and 9 unusable T1s/T2s with super low Dim1Size (20-32 voxels). We then reran the now backwards compatible add-nifti-info so that 3D scans got NumVolumes=1.0 added to their sidecars. Next we checked out an extra-anats branch, Matt deleted extra T1s and remove 'run' from the T1s we keep and saved. Validation/group running now! Came out clean. Group ran with session flag. Looks good. 
Next Steps: Add-nifti-info! RERUN ADD NIFT INFO AFTER T1S ARE DELETED! Keep VNav-Norm T2. Add events tsvs (have peer, need movieDM and movieTP). Decide on tolerances, apply changes, and push back to PMACS.

NKI
Datalad Status: untracked changes (Added 22 new subjects + nifti info) 
Git Branch: main
Cubic Path: /cbica/projects/RBC/RBC_RAWDATA/bidsdatasets/NKI
DSR: We purged 20 dwi scans with low number of volumes (less than dominant 137). We then identified that NKI was missing 51 sidcars. We uploaded 45/51 of the missing sidecars, and Alex is checking to see if he has the last 6. We then realized we accidentally initialized NKI as a datalad dataset without text2git, so the sidecars were in git annex. To keep things consistent with the other RBC datasets, we unlocked and ran datalad run-procedure cfg_text2git to remove the jsons from git annex. We uplodaded the T2s for subjects we currently have in NKI from s3 to cubic. Add nift info ran!! Save running now. MATT IS GOING TO UPLOAD 22 new subjects from s3! Group/validate ran now post adding 22 new. Add Nifti Info ran. Group and validate ran and came out clean.  
Next Steps: 2 OUTSTANDING ISSUES (see below). Ask Alex if they are currently still collecting data (Ted). They have T2s on s3 for subjects we don't currently have in NKI. Get 6 missing jsons, decide on config params, and truncate subject level events tsvs. 

HRC ISSUES
- VALIDATION: 11 new subs still quick validation failing! Matt and I found nothing wrong with them 

HBN ISSUES 
- ALL: ADD SITE-SI SCANS? THEY ARE ALL IN THEIR OWN PARAM GROUPS (32 GROUPS TOTAL)! 
- ANAT: Change T1 key group with no acq value to acquisition-SI
- ANAT: Need to delete some T2s, waiting on CMI for which ones (Mike or Alex)
- ANAT: RULE FOR T1s: Ideally, keep the VnavNorm scan with the highest rating. If unscored, keep best one (from plot), if can't tell difference, keep first run. If no VnavNorm, keep Vnav. If neither, keep HCP. 
- DWI + FMAP: tolerate Effective Echo Spacing, Total Readout Time, and Repetition Time
- FMAP: lots of missing PRFIP and MAF, want this in filename? want separate group because of this? SHORTHAND FOR ACQUISITION (UNSET SUGGEST VARIANT RENAME)! 
- FMAP: tolerate VoxelSizeDim1 (0.05mm)
- ADD PixelBandwith to sidecar params!!!!
- RERUN GROUP WITH SES INCLUDED IN GROUPINGS! 

HBN FINAL TOLERNACES 
ANAT: EchoTime: 0.001, 
DWI: group 1 = CBIC/CUNY, group 2 = RU, group 3 = SI, EES, TRT, TR 
FMAP: VoxelSizeDim*:0.05mm, EES:0.0001, TRT: 0.01 
FUNC: EES:precision=4, TRT:precision=2, 

 
NKI ISSUES
(1) sub-A00074953 has one T2w scan with a sidecar but no corresponding nifti. The following is the path to the sidecar missing a nifti: sub-A00074953/ses-TRT/anat/sub-A00074953_ses-TRT_T2w.json. This nifti is not on s3. 

(2) NKI has six T1w scans missing sidecars. See below for the list of missing sidecars: 
sub-A00028266/ses-BAS1/anat/sub-A00028266_ses-BAS1_T1w.json
sub-A00028339/ses-BAS1/anat/sub-A00028339_ses-BAS1_T1w.json

sub-A00028287/ses-BAS1/anat/sub-A00028287_ses-BAS1_T1w.json

(3) There are 22 subjects on s3 that are currently missing from our RBC repository. Do we want to add these subjects to RBC? See below for the full list of subjects on s3 but not currently in RBC: (UPLOAD TO CUBIC)
